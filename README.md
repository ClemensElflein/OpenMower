# About the Project

## Project Intro Video

If you want to see a quick overview, you can check out this video:


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSF04i3zNGw" target="_blank"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2864655/161540069-f4263fa7-a47b-49d2-a7bc-d1cdc3a47704.jpg" /></a>



Let's be honest: The current generation of robotic lawn mowers sucks. Basically all of these bots drive in a random direction until they hit the border of the lawn, rotate for a randomized duration and repeat. **I think we can do better!**


Therefore, we have disassembled the cheapest off-the-shelf robotic mower  we could find (YardForce Classic 500) and were surprised that the hardware itself is actually quite decent:
- Geared sensored brushless motors for the wheels
- A sensored brushless motor for the mower motor itself
- The whole construction seems robust, waterproof and all in all thought through
- All components are connected using standard connectors, therefore upgrading the hardware is easily possible.

The bottom line is: The bot itself is surprisingly high quality and doesn't need to be changed at all. **We just need some better software in there**.



# Project Goals

Here is a quick overview of this project's goals:

:heavy_check_mark: **Autonomous Lawn Mowing:** Obviously, the device should be able to mow the lawn automatically.

:heavy_check_mark: **Good Safety:** The device must be safe, e.g. emergency stop if lifted or crashed.

:heavy_check_mark: **No Perimeter Wire Needed:** We want to be flexible and support multiple mowing areas.

:heavy_check_mark: **Low Cost:** It should be cheaper than a mid range off-the-shelf product

:heavy_check_mark: **Open:** I want to share knowledge and enable others to build an OpenMower as well.

:heavy_check_mark: **Nice to Look At:** You should not be ashamed to have an OpenMower mowing your lawn.

:heavy_check_mark: **Avoid Obstacles:** The mower should detect obstacles and avoid them during mowing.

:heavy_check_mark: **Rain Detection:** The device should be able to detect bad weather conditions and pause mowing until they improve.



# Current State

The basic mowing function finally works! As you can see in the video, map teaching and mowing work as expected. It even returns to the docking station automatically as soon as the battery gets low and continues once it's recharged.

At this point I can recommend that brave tech savvy users can build one for themselves! Since it's quite an expensive and complex project, please don't be shy and ask if you have any questions. I'm glad to help ðŸ™‚



## Hardware

The first mainboard PCB is almost done. It currently looks like this:

![Current State of the Robot](./img/open_mower_mainboard.jpg)



### Hardware To-Do:

- [ ] Low Level Firmware Implementation
  - [x] Voltage / Current Sense
  - [x] Emergency Stop Button tracking
  - [x] IMU Communication
  - [x] Rain Sensor
  - [x] Charging State
  - [ ] Sound Module
  - [x] UI Board Communication
  - [ ] Low Power Mode
- [X] ROS Hardware Interface



# Software

The basic software is basically done; Our prototype works as intended (but is not able to avoid obstacles yet).

The software for the robot can be found in a separate repository: https://github.com/ClemensElflein/open_mower_ros

### Software To-Do:

- [x] Mowing State Machine (Docking / Mowing, ...)
- [x] Path Planning
- [ ] Obstacle Avoidance
- [ ] App / Visualization





# How You Can Help

You can help by starting an OpenMower build of your own. This helps to validate the concept and helps to create useful documentation for new users.

Additionally, you can help by starring ðŸŒŸ and watching ðŸ‘€ this repository, since it will help with visibility. You can also subscribe to my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/ClemensElflein).

## Getting started

Please refer to Wiki for the instructions on how to get started: https://wiki.openmower.de/index.php?title=Main_Page#How_to_Get_Started

## Compatible Robotic Mowers

While disassembling the bot, I wondered about its mainboard: Instead of "YardForce" it read "GForce". After checking the internet for "GForce" robots, I found that that very similar looking robotic mowers are sold under the Herkules brand. Naturally I tried to dig deeper and actually found evidence that the mainboard is manufactured by some chinese company (SUMTEC Hardware).

It is therefore quite safe to assume that many robot mowers are **basically the same device in a different case**. This would be a huge win for the community, since this would mean that by making one of those robots smarter, we could upgrade **A LOT OF ROBOTS!**

Therefore it might be a good idea to start a list of compatible devices. So if you have a cheap robotic lawn mower, it would be nice of you to check, if it contains the same mainboard as ours and send me some pictures / model numbers.
